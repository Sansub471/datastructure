auto init = []() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    return 0;
}();
This init block runs before anything else to disable C++-specific I/O synchronization with C’s stdio. It’s often used in 
competitive programming to speed up I/O operations, although it’s not directly related to solution.
