The learnings from the project will be here: 
1. .hpp and .h file difference
    By one convention, .hpp files are used when the prototypes are defined in the header itself. 
    Such definitions in headers are useful in case of templates, since the compiler generates the 
    code for each type only on template instantiation. Hence, if they are not defined in header files, 
    their definitions will not be resolved at link time from other compilation units. If your project 
    is a C++ only project that makes heavy use of templates, this convention will be useful.

    Certain template libraries that adhere to this convention provide headers with .hpp extensions to indicate 
    that they do not have corresponding .cpp files.

    Another convention is to use .h for C headers and .hpp for C++; a good example would be the boost library.
